1. Get the medians of two lists
2. Compare two medians, remove the beginning part of the one with smaller median, as well as the ending part of the one with larger media
3. Repeat the steps above, until one list has only one or two elements
4. Discuss in different situations

**Attention in step 2, in order to avoid removing useful information (the number determines the median, keep one more element close to the median).**

e.g. A = [1 2 6 7]  B = [3 4 5 8], in step 2 we get M(A) = 4, and M(B) = 4.5, but we keep A = [1 2 6] and B = [3 4 5] in next iteration.
