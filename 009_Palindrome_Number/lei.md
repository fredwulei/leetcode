There are couple of methods to determine a palindrome. The easiest way come into my brain is converting the integer to string and comparing with its reverse. But here I used the way with pure numbers, by iterating on all its digits and generating its reverse integer, then do the comparison. 

*This method may be improved by doing half of the work.*
